  to the following limitations:

  ALL the files must be distributed. The individual files must also be

  Terminate may NEVER be sold or distributed for profit or anticipated
  profit without the written permission of the worldwide distributor.

  Terminate may not be `bundled' with hardware without a written permission
  from the worldwide distributor. Cost-effective licences for Terminate LITE
  are available for modem manufacturers and distributors:

  Succinctly: no one other than SerWiz Comm and the authorised national
  Registration Sites may charge money for Terminate.

  Neither a personalised Key File, Terminate Lite, Terminate Professional,
  Terminate-f-W, Terminate NT or Terminate OS/2 may be copied (other than
  for backup purposes) or distributed.


                               OFFER OF LICENCE


  SerWiz Comm and associates hereby offers you, the reader of this offer, a
  licence to use Terminate for 21 days for evaluation purposes only in

                   We think Terminate is the final terminal.

  To encourage you to share copies of this evaluation version of Terminate
  with others we now have a little incentive for you:

  Every month beginning 1 January 1994, the Electronic Regsite will send
  out free keyfiles to some lucky Terminate users!

  But who is eligible?        When people register at the Electronic Regsite
  we now have the ability to detect the two people who previously copied the
  distribution files to the person upgrading to Terminate PROFESSIONAL.

  It is these two previous users (our `distribution team') that qualify for
  the free keyfiles!

  Winners are announced in Terminate Tech Support conferences

                To join the list of eligible prizewinners,  just
                spread Terminate around - the distribution files
                they need are in the \GIVEAWAY directory.....


  You MUST have used your real name upon installation since the prize will
  be sent to that address - so please make be sure that you filled in the
  information correctly when you installed Terminate!
  If you later decide to register and pay for Terminate, this information
  will be used to generate your personalised Key File. (You can't register
  Terminate under an alias such as Donald Duck).

  To register for an organisation also give the name of the person using the
  program. eg: Users Name (title and firm
                     if applicable):  Sir Oliver Smith / The Hunting Society
