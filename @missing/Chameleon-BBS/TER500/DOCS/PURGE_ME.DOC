WHICH FILES CAN I ERASE

This document will simply tell you what to erase if you don't need it.

You can delete the directory structures which you don't want to use anymore
with the Terminate file commander (Alt-F from the main terminal screen).

If you do not use Windows nor want to use Terminate under Windows at a
later time:
  Delete the directory TERMINAT\WINDOWS\

If you do not use OS/2 nor want to use Terminate under OS/2 at a later
point:
  Delete the directory TERMINAT\OS2\

If you do not have a fax modem or think you will ever get a faxmodem:
  Delete the directory TERMINAT\FAX\

If you do not have any filelists or think you will ever get some filelists:
  Delete the directory TERMINAT\FILELIST\

If you do not want to be able of calling home from a remote computer:
  Delete the directory TERMINAT\HOST\

If you have more than one directory starting with TLAN_???, you can delete
directories which contain online manuals in languages different than your
own. The number after TLAN_ corresponds to the country code for which this
online manual is created.
Therefore, TLAN_001 will contain the English language online help, TLAN_049
will contain the German manuals and so on. Delete the directory with the
language files you don't want.
Remember that the path to your language files must be configured in the
Alt-O menu, if it was not done automatically.

The DOCS\ directory contains a lot of rather small and useful documents.
Read the documents and delete the ones you don't need anymore.

If you only use normal BBS's with ANSI or AVATAR you could delete almost
all keyboard mappings in TERMINAT\PHONE\. Just keep AVATAR.KBD and
SITES.FON and delete all other files, not your own phonebooks of course.

The UTILS\ directory contains a lot of small and useful utilities, so I do
not recommend that you delete this directory. None of the files are taking
up much space anyway and you might need them later.

You must _not_ delete the TERMINAT\REGISTER\ directory until after you have
registered. If you do, you delete all the forms which you will need later
and might not have the original files anymore. However it makes good sense
to keep the registration forms for later reference anyway, so you should at
least keep your national form.
