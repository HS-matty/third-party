NOTES ON USING NODELISTS, POINTLISTS

Terminate supports normal raw nodelists, since a point rarely needs to
have a compiled nodelist. The only reason for using a compiled nodelist
is that searching is faster, and since points only search once in a
while, it is not worth having 2-3 MB of compiled nodelist on your disk.
As a new feature, Terminate creates a superfast small index file to
retrieve the entries from the nodelists faster if you know the address.

Terminate supports normal nodelists and is also able to use point lists.
Note the 'Point,9999' line in the example. Look below for the point list
formats supported by Terminate.

As a special feature, Terminate also supports the UBOSS: flag. If a line
starts with "Host", Terminate will look for this flag and grab the net/node
number and switch to pointlist format. This is used in a list called
DK-POINT.LST here in Denmark.
