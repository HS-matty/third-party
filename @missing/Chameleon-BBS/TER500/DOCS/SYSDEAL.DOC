                THE FIRST TERMINAL PROGRAM WITH A SYSOP DEAL

This special Sysop deal is for sysops who promote Terminate in their
bulletins or news menu or something like that and offer it for download.

   === CONTACT THE NEAREST REGISTRATION SITE FOR MORE INFORMATION ===

The deal is:

If 10 of your users register Terminate, you will get a free key file that
will contain your personal data (a free registration). If you have already
registered Terminate yourself, you can sell this key file (send new user
information) and keep the money for it. Then it's up to you to collect
registration fees and we will gather the registration forms from your users
in a separate folder and check them each time we get new ones. When we reach
the first 10 we will automatically send you the key. After that you will get
one free keyfile for each 10 keys you sell.

  10  Keys sold
   1  Free keyfile for you (or other person)
  10  Keys sold
   1  Free keyfile which you can sell to anyone and just keep the money

To join this system, you will have to fill out this form and send it
together with the first registration. There is a field in REGISTER.DOC
called BBS. Every time one of your users registers Terminate, they will have
to fill out this field with your BBS name, so you will have to tell them to
do this.

REMEMBER THIS: To join the deal, you must first send the registration
               information to your local registration site. Please call the
               registration site first and talk about this arrangement.

REMEMBER ALSO THIS: Send only this form together with money for the first
                    registration of a user. If we receive letters without
                    the first registration fee, it will be deleted/trashed.

In the file SYSDEAL.ANS there is an example of how a picture in your
bulletin menu could look like. You can change this if you want or redo it in
your own language. It's all up to you - we won't interfere as long as it's a
good deal for both sides.

You could also have a menu on your BBS that allows the download of
Terminate. Included in this package are TERMINAT.MNU, which is a menu
for RA/QBBS/SBBS, and TERMINAT.ANS/ASC, which are the graphics screens for
this menu. You can insert this menu if you like or change the language, you
can also get connected to the TERMINAT echomail area if you like.
