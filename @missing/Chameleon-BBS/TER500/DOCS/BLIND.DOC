The name of this document is BLIND.DOC. It can be found in the DOCS
directory of Terminate.

This file contains only information for people who cannot see.

Because we got a lot of personal requests from blind people, we decided to
create a few extra features which will help you to use Terminate even
faster and with far more ease than any other terminal program we know.

Most of you use some kind of speech device which only can detect BIOS
writes. Terminate will use direct screen writes in menus and BIOS calls in
terminal mode. You can also choose to use BIOS calls all the time.

If you select Blind Support during installation the following options will
be selected:

Sound is turned on giving you a sound when popping up or closing a window
Key click is turned on giving you a click noise every time you press a key
Only menus will use direct screen writes
The hardware cursor will be forced on all the time so your helper can see
the cursor
All sounds are turned on
Passwords will not be hidden
No automatic passwords will be generated
The Blind Transfer window will be used for file transfers
The File Manager will default to only one window
Some extra sounds have been added
In submenus all the background windows will be removed before displaying a
new window.

With blind support enabled, Terminate will always turn on the hardware
cursor so if you have a helper he/she can tell you if the cursor position
was wrong and report this error to me, the author of Terminate. This
function also allows you to press CONTROL ENTER and then move the cursor.
This will move the cursor position to the first position in the helpline at
the bottom of the screen, allowing you faster speech access. If no help is
found in a menu, when the menuline selector is used, then a beep will be
played: a high tone followed by a low tone.

To make things easier when transferring files, instead of the normal full
screen file transfer menu yours have been cut down to the actual
information needed. A sample picture is shown below. This window starts at
the position 1,1 (upper left corner) and the cursor is placed just before
the bytes transferred.

The menu looks like the following lines:

ีออออออออออออต Blind transfer ฦธ
ณ Filename      DANBBS.ARJ     ณ
ณ Filesize            2153297  ณ
ณ 75%                    8192  ณ
ณ CPS/Errors   3340            ณ
ณ H Hangup No     S Skip file  ณ
ิออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

Menu finished.

Line 1: The name of the file.
Line 2: The size of the file.
Line 3: How many percent and how many bytes have been transfered.
Line 4: Characters per second, speed of transfer and error count if any.
Line 5: H to hang up after transfer. S to skip the rest of file.

The message reader for Terminate is called TerMail. When starting up this
editor you could use the parameter /BLIND to enable special sounds and
features. If you call up TerMail from Terminate Alt-F7,L then this
parameter will automatically be added if you have enabled blind support in
the Terminate toggles menu. TerMail has a lot of sounds, as you will
quickly learn. Also, when reading messages, you can press Ctrl-Enter to
change the cursor location in the following order: To, Msg, From, Subject.
Just try it and you will quickly get used to it.

In the Terminate file manager you can press Q for Quiet, which will disable
the entire left side and make it easier to view the files.
