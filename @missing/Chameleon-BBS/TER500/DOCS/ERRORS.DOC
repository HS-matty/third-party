ERRORS/PROBLEMS AND HOW TO SOLVE THEM

- First try this -

If you are using QEMM386, 386MAX or a similar memory management program and
Terminate hangs when exiting to DOS or shelling or if you have any other
problem, then try renaming your autoexec.bat and config.sys first and then
reboot the computer.

  REN AUTOEXEC.BAT A.BAT <Ù
  REN CONFIG.SYS C.SYS <Ù

After this, your computer is totally clean of any device drivers and other
things that might mess things up. Now run Terminate and see if it still
hangs when exiting or shelling.

When using MS-DOS 6.0 or above, you can also press the F5 key on your
keyboard to bypass AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. Refer to your DOS manual
for more detailed information.

If it works perfectly, there is a conflict with your DOS configuration. Try
installing one device-driver at a time, reboot the machine and see if you
get the error message again. If it turns out to be QEMM or other memory
manager try excluding X=B000-FFFF. This worked on a PS/2 33MHz. If this
works, try X=B000-EFFF and proceed until Terminate hangs again. Other
programs which use XMS/EMS or high memory could also have problems, if you
did not exclude the correct area. You may want to say "but all my other
programs work", but the reason for your problems could be that as Terminate
is a very advanced program, it uses all the resources it can get to
increase the performance.

- Messy screen -

If your screen messes up when moving the mouse, try installing a newer
mouse driver. Download LMOUSE61.ARJ from DAN BBS: it also works with 100
and 132 column screen mode.

- XMS problems on old 286-machines -

If you have a 286 with an old BIOS and use HIMEM.SYS, there could be some
problems. Try getting the newest HIMEM.SYS from your DOS manufacturer or
use the /NOXMS command on the Terminate command line.

- PS/2 problem -

The mouse driver MOUSE.COM will sometimes conflict with EMS when using
Terminate. The solution is not to load the mouse driver into high memory.
If you use MOUSE.EXE 9.0 from MicroSoft, use the /E parameter to force the
driver to use convential memory.

- Real time-clock problems on XT-machines -

If Terminate detects that you are using an XT-machine (8088, 80186, 8086,
NEC V20, NEC V30), the soundcard check will be turned off by default. The
reason for this is that on some machines with a special realtime card
installed, the soundcard check sets off the date/time. If you want to try
to use the sound card anyway, start Terminate with a /YESCARD parameter on
the commandline.

- Terminate stops and nothing happens after a BBS login using IEMSI -

This is a common problem which appears when using IEMSI and enabling Avatar
codes at the same time. Avatar has the problem that it uses codes which are
identical to Xon/Xoff, which is something used for software flowcontrol.
The solution is easy: Make sure that your modem only uses hardware
flowcontrol (CTS/RTS) and turn off software flowcontrol. On some modems
this is done by typing:

 AT&H3  Enter
 AT&W   Enter       (Save setup in modem)

Please look up these parameters in your modem manual, if Terminate should
not support your modem directly.
