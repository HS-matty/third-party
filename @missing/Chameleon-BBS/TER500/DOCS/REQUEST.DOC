FILE REQUESTING WITH TERMINATE

File Requesting is an easy and efficient way to pick up files from a
FidoNet node without first having to go online in the BBS. This saves phone
costs and the hassle of having to log in for the first time, filling out an
user questionnaire etc.

You will find detailed information about how to request files in the online
help for TerMail and the Point System.

To know what files you can request from a system, you will either need a
file list from this system or you will have found the filename you want in
a message.

To get a filelist from a node, you should always be able to request the
magic name FILES and you will receive a file list. Be aware that some large
systems might send you file lists that are several MegaBytes large!
On big systems, you might want to request some information about the node
first. This can be done with the magic name ABOUT.

 Note: A "magic name" is a name which stands for one or more files which
       have a common "alias". For example, when you request TERMINAT at
       DAN BBS, you will not get a file named TERMINAT, but the latest
       version of Terminate, a file called XXXTER.ZIP where XXX stands
       for the current version number.

You might also find the name of a file which you can request when reading
a FidoNet conference, such as a request area (where people ask for files
and others offer new files in the file base of their BBS). TerMail offers
the possibility of easily requesting one or more files from a message using
Ctrl-F.

When you quit TerMail, you will find a file request package in your
outbound window. Now you can call that system and pick up the files you
wanted.

Sometimes, a file request will fail and you will not receive what you
wanted. Instead, you will probably get a netmail telling you about the
reason why your file request has failed.

Possible reasons for a failed file request are:

- You entered the wrong file name. Check whether you entered the correct
  file name in your request.

- The BBS where you tried to request files from re-packs the archives that
  arrive on his/her system. Therefore, the file might have been announced
  as GREATPRG.ZIP but it has been re-packed into GREATPRG.ARJ. Try
  requesting the file again, using a wildcard instead of the file
  extension. In our example, that would be GREATPRG.*

- The BBS where you tried to request only accepts requests from listed
  systems. If your point or node number cannot be found in its nodelist
  and/or point list, the system might not even give you a netmail reply but
  just hang up. Not nice, but some BBS SysOps are very strict about these
  things.

- The BBS where you tried to request files doesn't accept requests from
  points. Try getting the file(s) online instead, by logging into the BBS
  normally.

- The BBS where you tried to request files doesn't accept requests from
  Terminate users. This is rather unusual, but in Germany and other
  countries some SysOps have started to use special tools to keep Terminate
  users away.
  These SysOps claim that Terminate users are often using false node
  numbers and names to download a lot of files from their systems while
  blocking the line for other users.

Please, when requesting files with Terminate, be aware that you are asking
for a favor of the SysOp who offers these files. For most SysOps, these
files don't come free of charge, they have to request these files or
download them using so-called "file nets".

When requesting files, please observe the following unwirtten rules of
proper behavior:

- Never request under a false name or a false address.

- Never, NEVER request under the name and/or address of somebody else!

- Never try to request beyond the time/kbyte limits of that BBS by changing
  your name or address.

- Never try to request files during the so-called zone mail hour (ZMH) !
  The ZMH lasts from 2:30 to 3:30 GMT; it's purpose is to make it possible
  worldwide to crash mail to another node.
  A FidoNet node must fill this one minimum requirement: being online
  during the Zone Mail Hour. So if you do a file request during that time
  period, the system would not be able to send or receive important mail.

  Note: To find out what time the ZMH is in your country, from the Terminal
        screen in Terminate check Alt-M, GMT & time zones for information.

- If a request has failed for whatever reason, never write an angry message
  to the SysOp! It is unlikely that he/she will be better-disposed towards
  you if you behave in such a manner.

Some SysOps have become very irritated about file requesters using
Terminate. They send mean ASCII pictures to you if they see that you are
using Terminate. Just don't mind them and see whether you can get the files
somewhere else.

Should you be unable to get a file from one node, simply try another BBS.
Most files that are publicly available arrive through file nets, so it's
likely that not just the node you wanted to request the file from initially
will have it.

   Always keep in mind that file requests are not a right, they are a
   privilege! Some SysOps allow you that privilege, while others don't.

Good luck and have fun with the File Request feature of Terminate!
