EXTERNAL PROTOCOLS

Each of these protocols can be found on your local BBS or at our website
www.terminate.com. They are all included as default configurations in
Terminate. If you are a beginner, just use Zmodem - it is much easier to
understand. Here is some more information about the protocols. The prices
given are in US dollars and could be changed by the authors:

PROTOCOLS SUPPORTED DIRECTLY IN TERMINATE
=========================================

HydraCom                                  Filename: HYDRA108.ZIP  Price:  $0

A nice Bi-directional protocol just as Bimodem and HSLink. It has no
additional features, but the best thing is that it is FREE.

HSLink                                    Filename: HS121.ZIP     Price:  $0

Same as BiModem, just a newer program. Does the same things as BiModem.
My opinion is that it is just as good as BiModem. It gives you a lot of
information when transfering files.

BiModem                                   Filename: BIMOD125.ZIP  Price: $25

A very fast protocol that allows you to upload, download files and chat
with the sysop at the same time. Very good and stable.

GSZ/DSZ                                   Filename: GSZ0924.ZIP   Price: $30

GSZ and DSZ are the same thing. GSZ has just a little bit more screen
layout than DSZ. The screen layout is nothing to cheer about compared to
Puma, Bimodem or HSLink. But GSZ/DSZ are good standard Zmodem protocols.
It also has Xmodem, Ymodem (G and Batch). If you pay you get something
called MobyTurbo, but don't let this fool you because the other protocols
around are just as fast.

PDZmodem (Peter Mandrella)                Filename: PDZM124.ZIP   Price:  $0

A freeware Zmodem that also have the Zmodem 8k option also called ZedZap
which Terminate also supports internally. However this protocol is very good
for multitaskers especially when running Terminate in a DOS-box under OS/2

GifLink                                   Filename: GIFLK112.ZIP  Price: $30

A Zmodem that allows you to view GIF images while you download. Maybe a nice
feature if you really spend hours and hours downloading GIFs.

IceZmodem                                 Filename: IZM110.ZIP    Price: $25

A new cool Zmodem with MOD-player and chat facilities while transfering
files. If can use larger 2k block and a special reducement in overhead.
Furthermore you can get extensive information on the other ends system if
both ends are running this protocol.

Super Zmodem                              Filename: SZMOD200.ZIP  Price: $20

Very fancy Zmodem, with a lot of enhancements. It can do normal Zmodem
transfers as well. But while you are transfering files you can play
Tetris or Four-In-A-Row. To chat it demands of course that both ends use
Super Zmodem.

Puma/Mpt                                  Filename: MPT110.ZIP    Price: $15

Puma is an enhanced Zmodem with some extra compression and some real nice
fancy screen layout. It is fast, good and reliable. It was renamed from
Puma to Mpt because the company Puma (shoes) complained about the
use of this name (that was the rumour).

vFast                                     Filename: VFAST30.ZIP   Price: $15

This protocol claims to work faster and better than zmodem, but only with
error correcting modem. The screen layout if also quite good.

Jmodem                                    Filename: JMOD306.ZIP   Price:  $0

Again a fast protocol, but this protocol can send up to 8192 bytes in each
block. The best thing about this protocol is that an entire C-source is
provided with the program, so it can be compiled easily for other systems.
The program is public domain and there is no money charged.

Smodem                                    Filename: SMODEM10.ZIP  Price: $12

Smodem is a bi-directional file transfer protocol with full screen chat.
Supports: Windows, DESQview, Special com ports. Works with 7-bit Telnet.

OTHER PROTOCOLS TESTED WITH TERMINATE
=====================================

CMP                                       Filename: CHATMN23.ZIP  Price: $20

Chat manager protocol. A protocol that belongs to a package called Chat
Manager. It allows several users to chat with each other on multiline
systems. It supports RA,SBBS,MAX,OPUS,QUICK-BBS. The shareware price for
the BBS part is around 40$ non-commercially and the protocol is 10-20$.

                                     *

Remember that many of the CPS rates that these protocols claim are NOT
comparable. Please be aware that many things can confuse the calculation...
