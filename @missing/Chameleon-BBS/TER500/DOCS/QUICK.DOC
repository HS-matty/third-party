GETTING STARTED QUICKLY

For people who don't know much about serial communications and modems, we
provide this small document, so you don't have to worry about all the
options.

Remember always: If you don't understand an option/feature, do not change
its setting! All options have been set to sensible defaults for normal
use, and there is no immediate need to change anything - although you
will need to set up the following things:

At startup you will be asked about which colour palette you want to use.
Terminate will check if you have a colour screen and place the cursor on
"colour" if you do. Just press enter if you are not sure.

IMPORTANT: If you don't understand a toggle or an option, do not change it,
           just leave as it was. All options have already been set to give
           best performance for most machines.

Terminal settings: You can either let Terminate auto-configure itself for
your modem or set your modem up manually.
- If you have a modem faste than 14400 bps, you should set your bps rate to
  19200 or 38400. Fast modems can use data compression and if you only use
  9600, you will not be able to do fast transfers. If you are using faster
  speeds like 28800 set the speed to 57600. With ISDN you will need a
  fossil driver like cFos.
- For normal BBS calls you should always use 8 databits, no parity, 1
  stopbit.
- If you use 2400, you should disable Hardware RTS/CTS flowcontrol in the
  Terminal options menu. We always recommend that 9600 and faster modems
  should use Hardware RTS/CTS flowcontrol, which is the safest way of
  sending data when using a speed to the comport at 19200 or above.
- Don't ever run 57600 bps on external modems, unless you are sure that
  your cable is protected from noise - try 38400 first. Remember that you
  must also set RTS/CTS flowcontrol in your internal modem configuration -
  check in your modem manual.
- RTS/CTS flowcontrol requires an internal modem OR an external modem AND a
  proper modem cable which has the RTS and CTS (Request to send/Clear to
  send) pins connected.

When you are finished with the basic configuration, you can move to the
Modem & Dialing Menu and select a modem from Quick Install. If your modem
is not featured in the list, you must set the following things manually -
or at least check if they work (read your modem manual to check for further
details. Remember that the factory defaults on your modem may be set in
such a way that you won't have to change anything...):

Carrier Detect (CD) follows line (usually &C1):

- Type AT&C1 and press enter

When DTR is low, the line must be dropped, (Usually &D2 or &D3):

- Type AT&D2 and press enter

  Not all modems like this, if you can't hangup your modem, move to the
  Modem & dialing menu and Enter a 0 at the hang-up options which will
  allow Terminate to send a hangup string to your modem instead.

Type ATS0=0
Then your modem will not pick up the phone - so Terminate can make the
decision.

If you can save your setup in your modem, type AT&W, otherwise you should
use this initstring: AT&C1&D2S0=0^M

If your modem string is not sent because the carrier is high when you start
up Terminate, you should enable the FORCE INITSTRING switch in the Options
menu under "Modem And Dialing".

If your modem is standard Hayes compatible you don't need to set up
anything else, everything has been set up already.

You could now press Alt-D for the phonebook and import or enter some
entries - then you are ready to enter the world of CyberSpace!
