This is just an example of how easily you can enter information that will be
available in the bulletin menu.

Use an ANSI editor to edit/save BULLETIN.ANS and save it afterwards as
BULLETIN.ASC without colour codes. If you don't care about colours, just
erase all the .ANS files, then only the .ASC files will be displayed no
matter what.

The bulletin files should be named 'BULLExxx.TXT', where xxx is the number
the user has to enter in the menu to view the text. After viewing a
bulletin, the user will be asked if he/she wants to download the file or all
the bulletins. If everything is selected then BULLETIN.ASC will also be
downloaded, so the user can get a fast overview of the different bulletin
files.

The BULLExxx.TXT file can contain any type of information you want and in
whatever format you like. Just make sure that the other end is able of
viewing it. We recommand that only Avatar, ANSI and plain ASCII codes are
used.
