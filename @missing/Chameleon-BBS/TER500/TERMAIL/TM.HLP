 ^hTerMail Overview^n

  TerMail is an E-Mail-System for Terminate. It enables you to send and
  receive mail from other people through a variety of networks and systems.
  TerMail supports both Fidonet messages and offline mail (also called
  QWK-Mail or "Quick Packets"). When installed with Terminate, TerMail is
  ready to run out of the box without hardly any additional setup.

  As soon as you have a network address, you are basically set to go. As
  usual in the data-communication world, there will be a lot of new words
  for you to learn, but don't let this confuse you. If you just fail to
  understand something, don't change it or ask someone whether you need it.
  With TerMail, we have tried to create a powerful mail reader while keeping
  it as simple as possible. TerMail will practically do all the maintenance
  for you without you having to think about it. If you want special settings
  simply just edit the configuration files and follow the instructions.

  Without further ado, lets get started and get into E-Mailing...

                                                                /Bo Bendtsen

 ^hBLIND SUPPORT^n

  TerMail has, like Terminate, special Blind Support features which are
  designed for the Visually Impaired.

  When starting TerMail with the command line parameter /BLIND or the
  BlindSupport toggle, some extra sounds will be enabled. Furthermore, other
  special functions will be active such as the removal of unneeded windows,
  the change of some High ASCII special characters to Low ASCII and the
  hardware cursor will be enabled. This will make it easier to navigate
  through the screens.

  When reading messages, the cursor will always be placed at the position of
  the To-Name. With Ctrl-ENTER you can cycle between the message text body,
  from-name and subject. There are additional improvements which you will
  notice in daily use.

 ^hMain menu keys^n

  ^hF1 This help file^n

   Here you will find help for most of TerMail's functions.

  ^hF2 List of external utilities^n

   This displays a pop-up list of user-definable external utilities. You can
   scroll through the list, select and execute the tool you want to use.

  ^hF6 Forms^n

   Predefined forms that you can include in your messages. This could be
   your details, reports or if you are a moderator for a conference you
   could put the rules in a form file.

  ^hF7 Show/create groups^n

   Displays a list of the current Groups and allows you to change the group
   for the current area or to create a new one.

  ^hF8 Nodelist lookup^n

   Displays the nodelist(s) set up in TM.CFG and allows you to search
   through it (them) using the arrow keys.

  ^hF11 Nodelist search^n

   Search for any address or keyword in all nodelists

  ^hENTER Enter message area^n

   Area 1 is always the Netmail area. Netmail is used to send messages to
   other users. Only the receiving users will get them.

   Area 2 is the default area, where mail written to your user name in a
   conference is stored. Therefore if you have 200 areas, you can always
   check this area first and see if there is any new messages written to
   you.

   Area 3 will save all mail you have written. Sometimes it can be
   important to remember what you have told to whom at a certain time.

  ^hFast area selection^n

   When pressing either A-Z 0-9 . _ these characters will be appended to a
   searchword and leap to an area that matches the search string. Therefore
   you can get faster to areas of which you know the name. Only the EchoID
   will be searched for matches.

  ^hEsc Exit TerMail^n

   Exit TerMail. A window will pop up, asking you whether you really want to
   quit.

  ^hAlt-X Exit TerMail without asking^n

   Exit quickly, without asking.

  ^Alt-0..5^n

   Exit directly with errorlevel 0,1,2,3,4,5 without packing/cleaning

  ^hAlt-V View log^n

   Use a list tool to view the logfile. If you use the internal list
   function, at startup the list tool will immediately display the latest
   entries to the logfile.

  ^hAlt-P PID serial number check^n

   Check all messages for PID serial codes. With this function you can
   find people that are using the same keyfiles or keyfiles made with
   pirate generators. You can also use this program to find pirate-users
   of other programs like Golded (GED) or Frontdoor (FM).

  ^hAlt-Z Mega search^n

   Search all areas for keywords. Results are saved for the next time you
   enter the search.

  ^hAlt-J Shell to DOS^n

   This allows you to run external programs without quitting TerMail. Do not
   attempt to load TSR's since this will cause your machine to hang when you
   exit the DOS-Shell.

   Type EXIT to return to TerMail.

  ^hAlt-E Edit configuration and external files^n

   This menu will allow you to edit the configuration files directly.
   Please be very careful: Avoid changing or removing things you don't
   understand. Generally, TerMail works "out of the box" without the need
   to make manual changes.

   ^bTM.CFG^n

    This is the configuration file. Here you can set up everything. The
    configuration file also contains additional information about TerMail.

   ^bTM.BBS^n

    This is the area file. It contains all the TAG NAMES (or conference
    names) that you have. TerMail will automatically create new areas for
    you and place the entries in this file.

   ^bTM.NAM^n

    TM.NAM is a list of the people you often write to. If you have a friend
    called Steve Stacher, you could insert the following line:

    Steve,Steve Stacher,2:443/888,Nice weather today

    If you then just write "Steve" in the TO-name when you want to write a
    message to him, the information would be grabbed from this file and
    inserted, relieving you of the neccessity of remembering his address.
    If you always want to crash mail your messages to Steve, add a ",Crash"
    after the subject.

   ^bTM.LST^n

    This conference list is used by the Areafix manager. To get more
    information about this topic, press F1 in the Areafix manager.

   ^bTM.LOG^n

    This log file contains information about all the mail tossed and
    scanned by TerMail. Toss means import and scan means export. Here you
    can check where your mail has come from and where it went.

   ^bWHATSNEW^n

    The TerMail History file contains information about the latest updates
    and enhancements to TerMail.

   ^bTM.PIC^n

    The TM.PIC file is a text file with file names of the picture(s) you
    have on your hard disk of the people whom you are writing to.

   ^bTM.CC^n

    Used for carbon copies group or mailing lists

   ^bTM.RFM^n

    Used for reformatting messages when quote-replying

   ^bTM.SIG^n

    Used for inserting signatures in the internal editor on F5

   ^bTM.CRT^n

    Used for correcting commonly spelled word

   ^bOther file^n

    With this option you can edit any other file, using an external editor.

  ^hAlt-F File/Areafix manager^n

   The File/Areafix manager is a function that will connect you to
   conferences (the areas you receive mail in) and file-echoes where you
   can receive files. Think of Areafix as a friend of your SysOp who checks
   his/her netmails to see if you want to get connected to certain
   conferences. Normally you would have to write a manual netmail, but with
   the help of this unique feature in TerMail, you don't have to do
   anything other than tag the conferences and send the message. You will
   always get a reply from Areafix which will tell you if your request was
   successful.

   ^hThese special functions are available:^n

   ^b%LIST^n

    First you should always request a list of all the conferences that are
    available to you. Then you can create a TM.LST from this message. Look
    in TM.LST for more information about how to do this.

   ^b%QUERY^n

    Request a small list of the areas you are connected to.

   ^b%RESCAN^n

    All newly connected areas will be rescanned, so you will receive all
    the messages that are immediately available from your uplink. If your
    uplink does not keep the area you choose in his message base
    ("passthrough"), you will not receive any old messages, but you will
    receive messages in the future, perhaps tomorrow. You are not always
    allowed to rescan, but it will never hurt to try.

    Beware if you are a new user and you try to rescan 50 areas - if you
    should do this, you will be flooded with plenty of old messages.

   ^b%HELP^n

    Request help information from Areafix. Not all Areafix programs
    understand the same commands and requests, so getting this message back
    should be the first thing for you to try.

   ^b%PAUSE^n

    Temporarily suspend all connected areas. When you go on vacation, for
    example, you might not want to have to get all echomail saved up at
    your boss. Netmails will still be saved and stored for you.

   ^b%RESUME^n

    Resume all temporarily suspended areas.

   ^hEchofile^n

    Select which echofile you want to use for area tagging. By default an
    echofile is attached to your user record, but you can select another
    echofile for the current user if necessary.

   ^hSelect areas^n

    Press ^bSPACE^n to toggle a single area.
    ^b+^n Connect to this conference.
    ^b-^n Disconnect from this conference.
    ^bA^n Add this area to list.
    ^bE^n Edit the area list using the external editor.

    Gray keys (numeric keypad)

    ^b+^n Connect to all conferences.
    ^b-^n Disconnect from all conferences.
    ^b*^n Toggle the connect/disconnect mark on all conferences.

  ^hAlt-M Message base maintenance^n

   TerMail uses the external tool TMUTIL.EXE to perform maintenance work on
   the message base. This utility was written using the highly optimized
   Gecho technology created by Gerard J. van der Land.

   ^m⁄ƒ¥^t Message base maintenance ^m√ø

   ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ^n

   ^hPack area(s)^n

    Remove deleted messages from the message bases.

   ^hPurge messages^n

    Delete messages from message bases, depending on the age and the
    maximum number of messages allowed in the areas.

   ^hLink area(s)^n

    Update the reply links, this is also called "message threading".

   ^hUnlink area(s)^n

    Remove all reply links.

   ^hIndex JAM area(s)^n

    Create new index files for all JAM areas.

   ^hUndelete JAM area(s)^n

    If you purged, but didn't pack some JAM areas, you can restore the
    message(s) with this command.

   ^hSecure area^n

    Protect this area with a password, so no one can access the area
    without entering the password first. With this menu entry you can also
    remove the protection from the area.

   ^hConvert area to JAM^n

    Convert a MSG area to JAM message base. JAM message bases can help you
    save a lot of harddisk space since they only consist of 4 files each.
    MSG areas use 1 file per message and are much slower. If you use 8k
    clusters on your harddisk, an MSG area can use up to 6-8 times the
    space needed by a JAM area. If you want to convert a JAM area to MSG
    you first create a new area, mark all messages and select the MOVE
    command (M).

  ^hDELete Remove messages or entire area^n

   You cannot remove the Netmail area, so if you press DEL while the
   Netmail area is active, you will only be asked whether you want to
   delete all messages. When you press DEL with any other conference, you
   will be given three options.

   ^bRemove area completely^n

   This will delete the messagebase and remove the area entry in TM.BBS.
   Warning this will delete all messages even locked messages.
   TerMail will also send an Areafix message to unlink the area.

   ^bDelete all messages^n

   This option erases all messages from the area.

   ^bDisconnect with Areafix^n

   You can automatically send an Areafix request to your uplink to inform
   him that you don't want to receive mail in this conference anymore. You
   should choose this option before removing an area.

  ^hAlt-S Scan all areas^n

   If you are using a network or if you have pressed ENTER while the areas
   were being scanned, you might want to scan all areas again to check
   whether new messages have arrived since you started TerMail.

   ^hName^n

    Name of the receiver.

   ^hFidonet^n

    The receiver's address in a Fidonet-style format.

    ^hCrash^n

     Send the message with a crash flag when creating mail for this
     receiver by default.
     Crash means you call directly to a system to deliver your mail and
     don't send it through your Boss. Sometimes this is faster and more
     reliable, but it also is more expensive.

   ^hInternet^n

    An Internet-style address. The Fidonet address must point to the UUCP
    gateway you are using. You can, however, just specify an UUCP gate or a
    non-Fidonet address. Then the nodelists will be searched and you can
    choose between the gate you wish to use. When you have found a node
    where the gating works, you can replace UUCP with the Fidonet address
    and the nodelists will not be searched.

    The Internet field can only be inserted when the address book entry
    actually points to an Internet address. If you just want to save an
    Internet address for an entry, save it in one of the comment fields.
    Look in the nodelist for an UUCP or GUUCP-flag and contact these nodes
    for further instructions. Please note that some UUCP gates require an
    agreement before you can send mail through them, so please ask before
    you start sending through gates.

    Sending mail to an Internet address:

     You -----> Crash or           -----> UUCP Gateway -----> Receiver
     (Fidonet)  Routed via Fidonet                            (Internet)

       You can either crash or route a message to the UUCP Gate. The
       TO-field in the message header should be UUCP. The First line in the
       message has to be "To:internet@address.here". The UUCP Gateway will
       automatically send your mail to the correct receiver on the
       Internet.

    Receiving mail from an Internet address:

     Sender ---------> fidonet.org -----> Routed via Fidonet -----> You

       Simply ask people to send mail to the Internet address which every
       FidoNet user has.

       The format of your address is as follows:

       Bo Bendtsen, 2:236/111.3 :

       Name Spaces Point  Node Net  Zone Domain Organisation
          ≥ |          ≥  ≥    ≥    ≥    ≥      ≥
          bo_bendtsen@p3.f111.n236.z2.fidonet.org = 2:236/111.3

       If you are a node you can remove the "p0."

       That means that you can tell any people on the Internet to send mail
       to your Internet address using in the format described above. The
       sender will address his/her message to a normal Internet mail-server
       called fidonet.org. This server converts the message to a Fidonet
       style address and routes it like a normal Fidonet netmail. You will
       receive the mail faster or slower depending on how close you are to
       the gate that has been used.

    Replying to a mail from Internet:

       When you receive a netmail from an Internet address it will always
       to gated through an UUCP gate. This gate will insert two kludges
       called "REPLYADDR" and "REPLYTO". TerMail will grab these kludges -
       they hold the information needed for a reply. However, should these
       kludges not be found, TerMail will try and grab the "From: " string
       in the second line in the message header. A "From: " line has no
       information on where to gate the message back to Internet, so you
       will have to find a gate that works.

       A "From: " line could look like this:

         From: bo@serwiz.thegap.com

       The special kludges used for Internet replies (this is only an
       example!) are:

         @REPLYADDR bo@serwiz.thegap.com
         @REPLYTO 2:25/25 Bo Bendtsen
         (@ = ASCII 1)

   ^hOrganisation^n

    domain.

   ^hVoice phone^n

    The voice phone number of the receiver.

   ^hFax phone^n

    The fax phone number of the receiver.

  ^hF Request files (Alt-F, Ctrl-F)^n

   Find all the filenames contained in a message and request these files
   directly from the network address where the message originated.

   List all filenames in a message and select the file(s) you want. A
   message will be created automatically, requesting the marked files from
   the network address from which the message originated.

   Since people announce programs in many different ways, sometimes TerMail
   might not recognize all the filenames. If this happens simply edit the
   filename manually.

  ^hG Quote-reply to message (TO-name) (Alt-G)^n

   Quote the entire message and start editing your reply. This function
   sends your reply to the TO-name of the quoted message.

  ^hH UU-encoding/decoding^n

   Convert binary files into a 7-bit ascii format which can be inserted
   into messages and extracted by the receiver to its original binary form.
   Please be advised that some networks have restrictions on sending routed
   uu-encoded files. If the file is important, I would suggest that you
   crash the file directly to the receiver or the receiver's uplink (a.k.a.
   "Boss").

  ^hI Fidonet kludges^n (Special keywords in messages)^n

   ^bINTL   ^nInter-zone, kludge to assure a direction to the correct address

   ^bTOPT   ^nTo point. Will tell nodes to direct mail to this point number
   ^bMSGID: ^nOrigin address and an unique checksum for your system
   ^b        ^nThis is mostly used to ensure that the message came from the
   ^b        ^nright place and will sometimes be used for dupe-checking
   ^bREPLY: ^nInserted by editors when replying to msgs with a MSGID kludge
   ^bPID    ^nEditor ID and version number, sometimes registration codes
   ^bTID    ^nTosser ID and version number, sometimes registration codes

   ^b        ^nmsg has no AREA-kludge, it's a netmail/matrix message
   ^bSEEN-BY ^nUsed to display all the systems that have got this message
   ^b        ^nbefore you. Shows the systems through which the msg was routed
   ^b        ^nas well as their respective downlinks
   ^bPATH   ^nUsed to see exactly where the message is from and the route
   ^b        ^nit travelled to your system. Also used to detect duplicates
   ^bEID:   ^nEchomail dupe checksums, used for tracking down duplicates
   ^bFLAGS: ^nThe status of the message: CRA,IMM,HLD,DIR,CFM,A/S,FRQ etc

   ^bCHRS   ^nor ^bCHARSET^n, which charset was used to write the message
   ^bSPLIT  ^nKludge used by some systems to split up large messages
   ^bENC    ^nMessage is encrypted
   ^bMOOD   ^nSpecial TerMail kludge to display the mood of the msg writer
   ^bOrigin  ^nA line with info/address of the system where the msg came from
   ^b---     ^nTearline, a small advertising line for the mail editor

  ^hJ Jump to DOS (Alt-J, Alt-O)^n

   Start a DOS-shell to run an external programs.
   Note: You can't load a TSR in a DOS-shell and return to TerMail - you
   have to remove the TSR first.

  ^hK Toggle kludge information (Ctrl-K)^n

   Display special mail information in messages. You can disable this by
   default in the configuration, but generally for more advanced users the
   kludges can provide some extra information and give you a better view
   and understanding of the E-Mail kludges.

  ^hL List area (Alt-L, F9)^n

   This option displays a list of all messages of the current area, showing
   one line per message, so you can select and read messages faster. Press
   TAB to toggle between a view of selected messages or all messages.

  ^hM Forward/Copy/Move (Alt-M)^n

   Forward a message to other people or to another conferences. You can
   also copy or move message(s) to another area.

  ^hN Reply to this message in another area (Alt-N, F5)^n

   Use this option for example when you want to reply to an echomail in
   netmail (private mail).

  ^hO Change origin for group (Ctrl-O)^n

   Temporarily change the origin line for the group to which this area
   belongs. The default origin lines can be modified in the group settings
   of the configuration file.

  ^hP Change attributes (Ctrl-S)^n

   ^hMessage Range^n

    Set the range in which messages will be searched or marked.

   ^hSet range to last 500 messages^n

    Quickly set a range of the last 500 messages, can be useful if you have
    a large save area where you keep all you mail and you only want to
    search the latest messages.

   ^hSearch only marked^n

    To narrow down number of found messages, you can search only those
    messages that have already been marked. Assuming that you have already
    found all messages containing the key word "Terminate" and now you want
    to search only these messages for the keyword "point system", this
    will unmark all tagged messages that do not contain the keyword "point
    system" and only those messages which contain both "Terminate" and
    "point system" would stay marked.

   ^hHeader From/To/Subject^n

    Check the header for a matching searchstring.

   ^hHeader From^n

    Check only the From-name for a matching searchstring.

   ^hHeader To^n

    Check only the To-name for a matching searchstring.

   ^hHeader and text^n

    Check the entire message for a matching searchstring.

   ^hPersonal mail^n

    Only search mail addressed to one of your usernames.

   ^hRead mail^n

    Only search mail that has the received flag.

   ^hMark all messages^n

    Set the "marked" flag on all messages.

   ^hUnmark all messages^n

    Remove the "marked" flag from all messages in range.

   ^hToggle marks^n

    Toggles marks on the messages in range.

   ^hMark messages first->current^n

    Mark all messages starting with the first message in the area and ending
    with the current message.

   ^hMark messages current->last^n

    Mark all messages from the current message in the area to last message.

   ^hMark current range^n

    Mark all the messages in the range currently selected.

  ^hT Change template for group (Ctrl-T)^n

   Temporarily change the template for the group to which this area
   belongs. The default templates can be modified in the group settings
   section of the configuration file.

  ^hU Temporarily change user for group (Ctrl-U)^n

   Temporarily change the user name for the group to which this area
   belongs. The default users can be modified in the group settings section
   of the configuration file.

  ^hV View nodelists^n

   View the raw nodelists defined in the configuration file.

  ^hW Export message(s) (Alt-W)^n

   Export or print a message or all marked messages. You can also launch an
   external print utility for special print jobs.

  ^hX Area statistics, message tracking and address finding^n

   Gather extensive statistics about the current message area or track down
   the route taken by a message before you received it.
   TerMail can check an entire area for any Fidonet, Internet or CompuServe
   addresses contained therein and save them in an export file.

  ^hY Message statistics^n

   Display a simple message statistic.

  ^hZ Zap to next area^n

   This will make TerMail go to the following area immediately, without
   first having to leave the current area manually and then choosing the
   next one.

  ^hAlt-A^n SmartNote

   If you use The Internet or some other network where you have to remember
   hundreds of different strings or note down lots of information, then you
   cannot live any longer without SmartNote!
   The SmartNote function is better than writing long addresses down on
   paper because it is always ready for noting down anything needed at a
   later time. Backups will be made automatically.

   For example, if you see something on the screen that you wish to note
   down:

     1. Press Alt-K, mark and grab the text with the string grabber - the
        grabber can be adjusted in size and position with SHIFT and
        cursor-keys.
     2. Now you enter SmartNote by pressing Alt-A and import the grabbed
        information by pressing Alt-G exactly where you want the text to
        appear.

   NB: It does not matter where you see something on the screen as long as
   you still are inside TerMail or Terminate. The Alt-K string grabber will
   work everywhere.
   If, for example, you want to copy something to another note file, just
   follow the procedure above. If you want to test this powerful feature,
   enter Terminate, press Alt-O, press Alt-K and grab a part of some menu.
   Then start up SmartNote with Alt-A and insert the grabbed text with
   Alt-G. (You can grab information from the Online Manual and insert in a
   note file.)
   You can adjust the grabbers' size by holding down SHIFT and then
   resizing the window to be grabbed with the cursor movement keys (Arrow
   up, down, right or left). Z will Zoom the grabber to maximum size.
   Once you try this out, you will soon understand how powerful and useful
   this feature can be!

   The SmartNote editor offers the following functions:

   ^hSmartNote commands^n

    (Many of these commands are the same as the ones used by the Qedit
     editor by SEMWARE)

    Turbo Search will allow you to search through all note files very
    quickly, allow you to choose your match and jump to the position in the
    notefile where the match was found. If several matches have been found,
    you will be asked which match to use, as in the above example.

  ^hTAB Bookmark^n

   Set a bookmark. Press either SHIFT-TAB or the BACKSPACE key to return to
   the Bookmarked message.

 ^hCross-posting^n

  Cross-posting is a special way of writing a message once and
  automatically posting it in several areas without having to copy the
  message manually. It is very simple to use and only requires you to know
  the name of the conference where you want to copy the message to.

  Enter on any line in the message:

  XP: TERMINAT,TERMINATE.GER

  If the example above were written in the netmail area, your message would
  be saved in three folders: the Netmail folder, the international TERMINAT
  conference and in the German Terminate support conference TERMINATE.GER.
  The following lines would be inserted at the top of the message:

  * Crossposted in NETMAIL
  * Crossposted in TERMINAT
  * Crossposted in TERMINATE.GER

  If you need to cross-post a mail to more areas, just use several XP:
  lines.

  For compatibility reasons the abbreviation XC: will also be accepted.

 ^hCarbon Copy^n

  In your netmail area you can make copies of messages to multiple
  receivers. For this purpose you can use the cc: or bc: keywords directly
  in your messages. bc: is for blind copy or "Do not show in letter"
  otherwise the flags have the same function.

  Syntax:

    cc: address or group or searchstring, address or searchstring

  Each parameter must be seperated by a comma ,

  Examples:

  Send to the first 3 numbers and search entire nodelists for first
  match on Bo Bendtsen.

    cc: 2:254/261, 2:236/2000, 2:236/111, Bo Bendtsen

  Send to NC236, 2:236/111 and to the points 13 and 17 of 2:236/111

    cc: 2:236/0 , 111 , .13 , .17

  Send to first match in nodelists on Bo Bendtsen and to 2:236/111
  and remove all bc: lines in letter.

    bc: Bo Bendtsen, 2:236/111

  You can have as many cc: or bc: lines in your letters as you like, you
  should start the cc: line before anything else to make it look as good
  as possible. If you have a list of people that you always send messages
  to please look in TM.CC where you can create groups/mailing lists.

  Group example:

    cc: 2:236/0, &Customers

  If you want always to send crash to certain nodes, you can use the 'C'
  option.

    cc: 2:236/0, C2:236/111

 ^hTranslation editor^n ^hAlt-W^n

  When you receive messages in other character sets TerMail is able of
  translating these messages to your system. TerMail will assume that
  you are using IBMPC charset and translate to and from this set.
  If a CHRS: kludge in a message is LATIN-1, TerMail will load
  LATIN-1.850 if your codepage is 850. Whenever you reply to a message
  with a LATIN-1 kludge your message will automatically be translated
  back to LATIN-1 after you created the message. You can press Alt-W
  on a message and change the translation and see the how the characters
  are translated at once.

 ^hSemaphore files^n

  ^hTMRESCAN.NOW^n

  Create this file in the TerMail directory and all areas will be assumed
  unscanned and the next time you enter an area it will be rescanned. This
  file will be deleted afterwards.

  ^hTMFREEZE.NOW^n

  On a network you can freeze all TerMail editors, to prevent users to do
  anything with the databases. When the file is removed, users are again
  allowed to use TerMail.

  ^hTMNOTE.NOW^n

  Send note to user, that will pop up as a window and make a sound.

 ^hErrorlevels^n

  When TerMail exits the errorlevels will be set as follows:

  255   An error occured
    3   Netmail and echomail was written
    2   Echomail was written
    1   Netmail was written
    0   No mail was written
