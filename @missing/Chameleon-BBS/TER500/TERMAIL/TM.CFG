%
% Succinctly: By using this program, you agree not to hold Strathrory Systems
% Limited, SerWiz Comm or associates responsible for anything other than
% taking up a lot of disk space.
%
% If you like it and want to register to get the extra PROFESSIONAL features
% you must buy Terminate PROFESSIONAL, which can be obtained from an
% authorized dealer.
%
% TerMail cannot be bundled with any other programs.
%

%
% This program comes with Terminate, to help you to easily read and write
% netmail and conference mail.
%
% All Paths without a leading drive letter or backslash will be expanded
% to the TerMail directory. There is NO reason to change to the TerMail
% directory first before running this program. TerMail will change
% directory by itself and afterwards change back to the original path.
%
% Remember you can edit this file directly from Termail simply by pressing
% Alt-E from the area selection.
%

%
% This program will be discussed in Terminate conferences. Try connecting to
% one of the Terminate conferences mentioned below like TERMINAT (Global)
% if you need more help, support or information on Terminate or TerMail.
%

%
% If you want to make any changes, please do not remove the above message.
% That is our only demand, so please do not abuse this simple request.
%                                                                /SerWiz Comm

% All blank lines and lines starting with a % are comments and will be
% ignored when TerMail reads the configuration.
%

%
% Your network address must be in the following format:
% Zone:Net/Node.Point. You should ask your Boss what number you are
% allowed to use here. TerMail uses 4D node numbers.
% Boss address is the node number of your boss. If your boss has several
% lines/node numbers you could route the mail to one of the other nodes.
% PktPwd is something called PKT-password, only use this if your Boss tells
% you to. TerMail will ignore this when unpacking, since you are a point.
% In general TerMail will unpack everything (mail) in the inbound directory.
%

%
% Normally only one address is used, but if you have several point or node
% numbers in different networks you should enter two definitions. You can
% assign each user to a group. When you write in an area, the user is
% selected depending on which group the area is assigned to. Look at the
% part with the group definition below. You CANNOT change the order of these
% lines, and ALL LINES MUST BE PRESENT. Remember you can temporarily change
% the user by pressing the U button.
%
% If you want to have all highbit characters replaced with another character
% before saving the message, just enter the character on the HIGHBIT line.
% Some networks do not allow these characters, so you can enable this if
% it is demanded. (Highbit characters are ASCII 128-255).
%
% In Fidonet you will normally only have one user. If you have a
% node-number, just set the Address and Route-To to the same address such
% as 2:254/261. If you want to test your mail transfer with someone, you
% are allowed to send test messages using point number 2:254/261.9999
% through 2:254/261 which is SerWiz Comm in the UK. However, it is
% recommended that you find a closer system to connect with.

% Comment: The purpose of Arealists
% ---------------------------------
%
% To connect to any area you normally have to send a netmail message to a
% program called 'Areafix'. TerMail will allow you to automatically connect
% or disconnect to any area found in the file mentioned below. This file must
% have the syntax:
%
% EchoID-name    Description   Ex: 'TERMINAT   International Terminate'
%
% 1 area on each line.
% Ask the Areafix system for a list of all available conferences you can
% connect to.
% TerMail can write these with its AreaFix manager. First write a %LIST
% command, then you will receive a netmail containing all the areas you
% can connect to on your next call to your boss. Export this message and
% remove its header/footer, so it matches the syntax above. When sending
% AreaFix requests, the subject is used for your password. When you are a
% point, it is usually the same as the mail session password, but it
% depends on what your boss decides. The default echo file includes all
% Danish Fido conferences and a lot of international conferences. The file
% has to be located in the TerMail path.

%
% These are the (un)packers supported by TerMail at the moment:
%
% PackType options: ZIP, JAR, RAR, ARJ, LZH, ARC, PAK, ZOO, DWC, SQZ, UC2

% Normally when you send mail to Internet the TO-field in the message header
% must be UUCP. However, if you remove it here the real TO-name will be
% used. In special cases, you can also insert any other string.
%

InternetGateName   UUCP

%
% When you write an Internet address in the TO-field, TerMail will detect
% it and use the InternetGateName as username, InternetGateway address
% as destination address and insert to/from lines in top of your message.
%

% Where is Terminate located. If you have registered Terminate and have a
% TERMINAT.KEY, this is where the keyfile will be found. You can also copy
% the keyfile to your TerMail directory and specify the path to TerMail in
% this statement. The keyfile will enable some extra features you only get
% when you register Terminate.
%

Terminate   ..\

%
% Where your private netmail (sometimes called matrix, directmail, personal
% mail etc.) messages should be located.
% Netmail is personal mail sent directly to you. You can also send netmail
% to other points or nodes. These letters are not public and should only
% be read by the sender/receiver.
%

Netmail     NETMAIL\

%
% Where to look for incoming mail.
% If you are using Terminate this will be the default directory where all
% mailfiles are downloaded to, with the pointsystem.
% ..\ means 1 directory up (Normally C:\TERMINAT\IN\)
% Remember that path-names are expanded at startup. So if Terminate is
% located in C:\MODEM\TERMINAT , ..\IN\ would be expanded to
% C:\MODEM\TERMINAT\IN\ . The same thing goes for the outbound.
% QWK packages must also be placed here.
%

Inbound     ..\IN\

%
% Where to store outgoing mail. Always use ZONE as subdir, so messages to
% other zones will be stored in OUT\ZONE.006 (Zone 6) etc.
% When you write a message, it will be packed in this directory and the
% next time you call a system or your boss, the mail will be transferred.
%

Outbound    ..\OUT\ZONE\

%
% Where to store out .REP QWK-offline mail packages. This is only created
% if the conference in question is a QWK offline conference.
%

QwkReply    ..\UPLOAD\

%
% Since QWK letters can be private, you will be able of setting the
% private flag. You can either have TerMail to ask everytime you write a
% message or you for force it on/off. You should never use YES here.
%
% Options: Ask, Yes, No
%

QwkPrivate  Ask

%
% If you want the Tossing/Scanning/Packing information to be saved in a
% logfile, use this statement. The last parameter will tell TerMail to erase
% the logfile whenever the filesize becomes longer than X kilobytes. Enter a
% 0 if you never want the logfile to be erased. The same logfile will be
% used by tmutil.exe to record the use of the threading and indexing
% utility.
%

LogFile     TM.LOG     128

%
% Log in this file for each message you write. In that way you can
% keep exact track of who you wrote to without keeping all the messages.
%

SendLog     SEND.LOG

%
% When exporting by pressing W, the default directory can be set in here.
% .\ indicates the TERMAIL directory.
%
% If the ExportFile option is disabled, TerMail will use the area name for
% the export file. Otherwise, if you want to export to the same file every
% time, enter the name here. For printer output use PRN, LPT1, LPT2 or LPT3.
%

ExportPath  EXPORT\
% ExportFile  EXPORT.TXT

%
% When exporting, a special utility can be set up to print the exported
% file instead of doing it through TerMail. You could use a batchfile as
% shown. !Q on the command line will ask for a string and insert this
% instead of !Q.
%

ExportUtility   C:\JETCOL\JETCOL @FILE -R0 -M5 -W80 -L220 -F6

% ExportUtility   C:\2COL\2COL @FILE -K -F4 -L170 -J
%
% Make your own batchfile where %1 will be the filename to handle
% printing.

% Example PRINTMAN.BAT
%
%  @ECHO OFF                 <- Turn echo off

%  CONVERT %1                <- If you need to convert something
%  COPY %1 PRN               <- Copy document to printer
%  COPY FORMFEED.TXT PRN     <- Change page on printer (ASCII 12)

%
% Disable the following statement if new areas should be adopted as MSG
% message base. Otherwise JAM style will be used since it is faster and
% saves a lot of diskspace.
%

NewAreasJam

%
% Where new echomail directories should be created.
%

NewAreas    ECHO\

%
% If you are using TerMail as a mail-reader with an external tosser/packer
% like Gecho/FastEcho (if you are a node exporting to other systems). You
% can enable this option that will write 1 line per message with the JAM-
% messagebase path and the message number. Then programs that support the
% ECHOMAIL.JAM standard can scan you messagebase faster instead of having
% to scan the entire messagebase. It only works for JAM-areas.

% Overview: Automatic message management functions
% ------------------------------------------------
%
% -AutoToss-
%
% If you do not want the question: "Toss incoming mail", and just want to do
% it every time there is any mail, then enable AutoToss.
% This will also skip the "press any key" after tossing.
%
% -NeverToss-
%
% Never toss or ask to toss mail.
%
% -AutoLink-
%
% Automatic update of message links, also called message-threading on areas
% into which new messages are tossed
%
% -AutoPack-
%
% If you don't want the question: "Do you want to pack mail for sending now",
% and instead just want to pack your mail automatically, enable AutoPack.
%
% -NeverPack-
%
% If you never want to pack mail any you don't want to asked about it
% either, use the NeverPack command.
%
% -AutoNetmailSave-
%
% Move received messages for your defined users to the NetmailSaveArea.
%
% -AutoClean-
%
% If you want automatic cleaning of areas (Max-messages and renumbering),
% then enable AutoClean.
%
% -NeverClean-
%
% If you never want the cleaning to be performed. Perhaps if you are sharing
% the database with another program, enable NeverClean.
%
% -AutoBackupJam-
%
% Whenever the JAM message areas are packed or maintained, backups can be
% made for security reasons. The backup files will have file-extensions:
% .!DT .!DX .!HR
%
% -AutoUpdateNodelist-
%
% No checking on nodelist updating, just run automatically. Disable this
% only if you have no unattended events. Beware that faulty updates and
% nodelists will be deleted. However, the old nodelist will remain. When
% disabled, you will be prompted with questions about which files should be
% removed. The only way to completely disable nodelist updating is remove
% the entry in the Nodelist statements.
%

% AutoUpdateNodelist

%
% Nodelists are used to get information about the people you are writing
% to. In these lists you can find a persons network address and other
% information. TerMail is capable of reading uncompiled nodelists and
% pointlists, including the 'UBOSS:231/111' flag and the 'Point' keyword.
% If you are using nodelists that end with a number (example: NODELIST.239),
% enter NODELIST.* so TerMail will always use the nodelist with the most
% recent time stamp.
% The nodediff parameter is used only when you have the possibility to get
% DIFF files which contain just the changes from the previous week. DIFF
% files are used because the nodelists are very large files and it would be
% a huge waste of money to download complete lists every week. The DIFF
% files will be downloaded to your inbound and unpacked there as well. If
% the update passes an internal checksum check, the old nodelist will be
% deleted automatically.
%
% Max 16 nodelists can be defined.

%  Style colors
%
%  To give your messages some extra features that still can be read by any
%  reader without converting the messages, you can enable these special style
%  colors. An example. Your message text would normally be cyan using the
%  default settings. However if you enter the string " *Hello* " on a line
%  it will turn light purple. Use the TEXTATTR.EXE function or the built-in
%  function in Terminate in the screen setup to find the color codes.
%  This function is in most cases compatible with Golded. Please be aware
%  that such a function cannot be perfect and could give you strange color
%  combinations in the middle of your message.

% Terminate will send everything to your Boss except the things that are on

% create .CLO files. If it is removed, then TerMail will create .FLO files
% instead. If you do not know what all this means, just leave it the way it
% is. Please note that Areafix requests and file attaches are always crash
% by default. These kind of messages and files should always be sent crash.
% However you can change the attribute before the mail is packed.
%

CrashBoss

% NETMAIL attributes
% ------------------
%
% These are the flags you can toggle when writing a netmail:
%
%  C  Crash             Send message directly to receiver; if you send
%                       a message to another point it will be routed through
%                       his boss. 2:236/12.27 -=> 2:236/12
%  S  Sent              When TerMail has sent a message this flag will be
%                       set, so TerMail know that the message has been
%                       processed. If you want to send the message again,
%                       change a message and remove the sent (Snt) flag.
%  A  File attach       Send file(s); the filename(s) must be in subject
%                       and each filename must be separated by a space.
%  K  Kill/sent         Delete message after it has been sent.
%  L  Local             Only Local messages will be sent by TerMail.
%  H  Hold              Hold the message, send it later.
%  F  File request      Request a file, filenames in subject 'FILES DANBBS.ARJ'
%                       Each filename must be separated by a space.
%  R  Request Receipt   Some systems allow you to get an automatic reply if
%                       the person has actually read the message you sent.
%  P  Private           Only matters in QWK areas, since netmails normally
%                       always are private and echomail is always public.
%  V  Received          The "V" flag is set when a message has been read.
%                       Can be unset but will be automatically reset when
%                       the message is read again. This works also together
%                       with "R" Request Receipt, so the confirmation of
%                       a receipt (see Confirmation) can be re-raised if
%                       the "V" attribute is not set.
%

%
% Allow asking about Zonegating. If disabled, Zonegates will never be used.
% Sending netmail through zonegates can insure that your message will be
% received by the correct person, where other netmail might be lost. Of
% course nothing can be compared with sending crash directly, but then you
% have to pay for the international telephone call. Zonegates only work
% if the sender and receiver are in zone 1-6.
%

UseZoneGates

%
% Use this if you have problems with messages arriving in the wrong zone.
%

ForceINTL

%
% Some networks require that you tell which character set you are using.

%

% CharsetKludge  CHRS: IBMPC 2

%
% If you for some really strange reason want to disable the use of the
% MSGID and REPLY-kludges in your messages you can enable this. However
% beware that many other programs use these kludges to generate reply-links
% which enable you to fast scroll back on a message thread. This function
% only works in echomail areas. Only absolute nutcases that are worried
% about saving the last byte would turn this off.
%

% NoMsgId

%
% To insert the Timezone kludge you must know what zone you are in. You do
% not really need this kludge except under extreme situation and I suggest
% that you keep it off unless someone asks you to enable it.
% A full list of timezones are in the TERMINAT.HLP under Greenwich mean time.
%

% TZUTC  0100

%
% If you are a member of several networks or have several addresses
% you can enable this feature which will select the correct user
% for you, but then you will be asked every time to confirm the automatic
% user selection and this could become a little irritating.
%

AutoUserSelection

%
% When writing messages to users that do not exist in the address-book,
% Should TerMail automatic add them as new entries.
%

AddressBookAutoAdd

%
% When writing new messages, the address-book will be searched for the
% persons you write to the most and a window will allow you to quickly
% select this receiver again. Disable this if you don't need it or you
% have an extremely large address-book and you feel this feature would
% slow down your system.
%

UseFavourites

%
% TerMail will always check your Carbon Copy lists (cc:) for duplicate
% nodenumbers. However TerMail can also check duplicate names and only
% send to the first found. This will however mean that if two persons
% are called the same, only the first will be used. In this case you
% could disable this statement. Look in TM.CC for more information on cc.
% If you send several message through a gateway and do not want any dupe
% check at all, enable the statement "DisableDupeCheck"
%

% Packing and unpacking mail archives
%
% Fido-mail
% ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
% Your mail will arrive in packed files. TerMail will test the archive and
% find out which type of unpacking is required.
% A packed message file is always called after the name of the day + #:
% MO#, TU#, WE#, TH#, FR#, SA#, SU#, where the # is a number from 0..9.
% Inside these packages, one or more .PKT files are stored. These files
% contain one or several messages which will be tossed into the netmail
% area or the appropriate echomail area. They are converted to a .MSG format.
% When packing the .MSG files that you have written will be converted into
% a .PKT file and packed with the packing program. I recommend PKZIP version
% 2.04g or higher, since it is the fastest. After packing your mail, a flow
% file will be created in your outbound and the next time you call your
% Boss, the mail will be send. The Terminate Mail System only supports
% Binkley style. The parameters were grabbed from Gecho, thanks to Gerard
% van der Land.
%
% QWK-mail
% --------
% When unpacking QWK packages. TerMail will look for files matching '*.Q??',
% just like most QWK readers. DANBBS.QWK will match, DANBBS.QW1 will match,
% DANBBS.OPX will not match. TerMail will of course determine which of the
% unpacker to use. If the conference belongs to DANBBS.QWK, then whenever
% you write a message in the conference, it would be packed into DANBBS.REP
% with the packer specified below.
%

%
% Only one packer can be defined for each user.
% Only mail to your Boss that is not Crash or Hold will be packed.
% When packing TerMail will change to the outbound directory.
% Do not disable any of these lines even if you do not have all the packers.

% You do not need to change these, just make sure that at least the

% unpacker to use from the ones available. You should not remove any,
% even if you do not have the corresponding program. Just leave these alone.
% When unpacking TerMail will change to the inbound directory.
% Beware that if an unpack program is downloaded in the inbound directory
% it will be used. Just keep in mind that if your boss does not like you he
% could: REN FORMAT.COM PKUNZIP.COM and send you the file. So be very nice to
% your Boss! (or edit the unpack commands below file so that they point to

%                            -----------------
%
% TerMail divides your conferences into groups, so you easily can add a
% new conference without setting up anything. The group function is one
% of the most powerful features in TerMail and it is important that you
% read the instructions and understand the purpose of having groups.
%
% Max. 23 groups are allowed
%
% This is how it works: Each area is assigned to a group
%                       Each group assigned to a user, an originline, a
%                       language template and some other things, see below.
%
%                                    |-> User 1
%                                    |   User 2

%                                    |-> Character set
%
% Group
%   Name of the group. Do not use any blanks here.
%   The only reserved group name is "New" which will be used by default
%   whenever creating new areas.
%
% Days
%   When cleaning, for how many days do you want to keep messages, based on
%   the message header date. For example: 7 days would mean that when a
%   cleaning command will be carried out, all messages that are less than 7
%   days old and which are not be affected by the maximum message number
%   limit specified in "Max" will be kept. If the number of messages which
%   are younger than 7 days is higher than the maximum number allowed, the
%   oldest messages will be deleted.
%
% Max
%   The maximum number of messages to keep in the area after a clean process.
%   Use 0 if you never want to delete any messages.
%
% Clean
%   This value is the number of messages that will trigger a clean.
%   The Clean value cannot be smaller than the Max value.
%   For example: If you have 1200 netmail messages in matrix, TerMail will
%   clean out the oldest messages and only leave the 1000 most recent ones.
%   If you never want any messages to be erased, just use a 0 in Max.
%
% User
%   Which user to use for this group.
%
% Tmpl
%   Which template to use for this group.
%
% Origin
%   Which origin line to use for this group. Use R for random selection
%   of an originline.
%
% Ask
%   Pop up menu and allow you to select the origin line manually,
%   defaulting to the origin selected above.
%
% Mood
%   Enable mood for group. Use this if you want to add the special
%   TerMail mood control information to you message, which will tell
%   the receiver(s) which mood you were in when you wrote the message.
%
% Charset
%   Which charset to use for translating messages in areas belonging to
%   this group. IBMPC is the default which means NO translation.
%
% Default to name
%   When starting a new message.
%   All blanks must be replaced with underscores '_'.
