PHP-NUKE: Web Portal System
===========================

For the Next Version you can expect:

- Complete themes code cleanup and reorganization to fit HTML standard
- IMAP/SMTP Web based mail reader
- Newsletter
- Mail users functions

For the future versions I'll add some cool features, basicaly:

- Glossary
- Themes Builder
- Encyclopedia Generator
- Quotes system
- Walk in the code to add/remove shit when needed
- Users online help system
- Better and 100% "working" moderation system
- Registered users only blocks
- Some other cool features. Do you have any ideas on how to improve PHP-Nuke?

In the long-long future I'd like to add:

- Virtual Store (e-Shopping)
