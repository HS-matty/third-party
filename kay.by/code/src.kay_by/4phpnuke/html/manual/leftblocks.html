PHP-Nuke, in the Home, can display Left and Right blocks
with custom info. In this section you can customize the
text and/or images you want to display in the LEFT blocks.
Left blocks will appear generaly at the left of the site
pages, but this depends of the theme you use.<br><br>

<b>Change Block:</b> To edit a block, just change whatever
you want in the block you want to change. You can change/edit
the block's title and content. After editing it you can save
the new content by clicking on the <i>OK</i> button. Make sure
to have selected the option <i>Change Block</i> at the left
of the OK button. You can edit ONLY one block at time.<br><br>

<b>Delete Block:</b> If you select this option and then click
the <i>OK</i> button, that block will be deleted, and the next
block will take the deleted block position in the page.<br><br>

To <b>Create a New Left Block</b> just fill the form at the bottom
of the page with the title and content for the new block, then
click on the <i>Make Block</i> button. The new block will be the
last one in the active blocks list.<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> You can use whatever HTML code inside your blocks,
but you can not use PHP code or SSI includes routines.<br><br>
