If you are administrator you will have a custom left
block (or right one depending of your theme). You can't
delete the Admin Block and you just have one block.<br><br>

Be creative and put in the Admin Block usefull links, like
a link to NEW article function, Admninistration Menu, Banners
Administration, etc. Whatever you like. You can use HTML code
but not PHP code inside the Admin Block.<br><br>
