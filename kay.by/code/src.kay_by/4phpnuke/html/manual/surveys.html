Be cool and change your Surveys frequently. To add a new Poll
you need just to fill the form in this page.<br><br>

<b>Poll Title:</b> Title for your new Poll.<br><br>

<b>Options:</b> The poll options, please fill at least 2
options, you don't need to fill all of them.<br><br>

<b>Delete Polls:</b> To delete one or more existing Poll,
click on <i>Delete Poll</i> link. After that you will see another page
with the list of all your site's polls. Check the poll you want to delete
and click on <i>Remove</i> button. Remember: there aren't confirmation
when you delete a poll, just click and the selected poll will go to the
hell!<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> Please double check your title and your options,
because you will not be able to edit the poll after you click
on <i>Create</i> button. This is because is not funny to let the
administrators manipulate the surveys like other systems do. Is
not fair and not ethic, so... be carefully when you type here.<br><br>
