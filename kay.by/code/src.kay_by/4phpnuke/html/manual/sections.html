Name</i> in the correct table. Also you need to select a filename for
the section graphic. The graphic need to be located under <i>images/sections</i>
directory. In that directory we included a file called <i>template.gif</i>
to show you an example of one good graphic size and format, but you can use
any graphic you like.<br><br>

To <b>edit a section</b> you need to have created at least one. Then you will
see many more options. One of then is for edit a section. Click on the section
name to edit it, after this you will see a new page with the option to change

select the section to attach it and then write the content and click on the 
<i>Add Article</i> buttom. <b>NOTE:</b> If you want to store the article in
the database but don't want to make it visible to the visitors, just don't
