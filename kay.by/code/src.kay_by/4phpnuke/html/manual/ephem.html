What is Ephemerids? Past events... just that. Some sites will be happy to
have Ephemerids to inform visitors on what's happened in the past exactly
in this day. The configuration is very easy. Ephemerids will show a box
on left side of the home. You need to activate this function in Preferences.<br><br>

To <b>add a new ephemerid</b> select the day, month and write the year
and the description for that event. When your system reach the day and month
you will see what happened in the story on that day and in what year
happened the event. For example you can set one event like: Day 12, Month
10, Year 1492... when users comes to your page on October 12 of any year
they will see a box that says that Colon arrives to America.<br><br>

To <b>edit or delete</b> an ephemerid just select the day and month
you want to edit/delete.<br><br>
